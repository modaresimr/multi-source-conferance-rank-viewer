The Editors select manuscripts based on their novelty and wide biological significance. Although the primary emphasis of the journal is on molecular components and their interactions, systems studies at the organ level may also be considered. Works describing large-scale datasets will be judged, in part, by the extent to which these datasets are integrated both with each other and with computational models, with the ultimate aim to better understand the dynamic and complex nature of living systems. Reports of new experimental methods will also be considered in the context of this policy. Topics falling within the scope of the journal include, but are not limited to: - integrative genome-scale biology - quantitative biology - computational biology - metabolic and regulatory networks - evolution of genomes and biological networks - clinical and translational systems biology - synthetic biology and genome-scale biological engineering - Molecular Systems Biology publishes research articles as full-length Articles or short Reports.

It thus attends to digital content generated through online and offline practices in social, commercial, scientific, and government domains. This includes, for instance, content generated on the Internet through social media and search engines but also that which is generated in closed networks (commercial or government transactions) and open networks such as digital archives, open government and crowdsourced data.

As well, a number of processes can be modeled using logical networks, as in the scheduling of interdependent tasks, the dating of archaeological artifacts, or the compilation of subroutines comprising a large computer program. Networks provide a common framework for posing and studying problems that often have wider applicability than their originating context. The goal of this journal is to provide a central forum for the distribution of timely information about network problems, their design and mathematical analysis, as well as efficient algorithms for carrying out optimization on networks. The nonstandard modeling of diverse processes using networks and network concepts is also of interest. Consequently, the disciplines that are useful in studying networks are varied, including applied mathematics, operations research, computer science, discrete mathematics, and economics. Networks publishes material on the analytic modeling of problems using networks, the mathematical analysis of network problems, the design of computationally e\ufb03cient network algorithms, and innovative case studies of successful network applications. We do not typically publish works that fall in the realm of pure graph theory (without signi\ufb01cant algorithmic and modeling contributions) or papers that deal with engineering aspects of network design. Since the audience for this journal is then necessarily broad, articles that impact multiple application areas or that creatively use new or existing methodologies are especially appropriate.

It is a leading journal in the area of smart materials and structures, publishing the most important results from different regions of the world, largely from Asia, Europe and North America. The results may be as disparate as the development of new materials and active composite systems, derived using theoretical predictions to complex structural systems, which generate new capabilities by incorporating enabling new smart material transducers. The theoretical predictions are usually accompanied with experimental verification, characterizing the performance of new structures and devices. These systems are examined from the nanoscale to the macroscopic. SMS has a Board of Associate Editors who are specialists in a multitude of areas, ensuring that reviews are fast, fair and performed by experts in all sub-disciplines of smart materials, systems and structures. A smart material is defined as any material that is capable of being controlled such that its response and properties change under a stimulus. A smart structure or system is capable of reacting to stimuli or the environment in a prescribed manner.

The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics: Type 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search. Type 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand. Type 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary learning and optimization methodologies.", "Review": {"2020": {"First": 76, "Final": 297}}}, {"Rank": 332, "Sourceid": 21101019738, "Title": "Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "25781863", "SJR": "0,823", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q1", "H index": 8, "Total Docs.

Established in 1987 with the mission of promoting research and disseminating information about distance education in the Americas, AJDE explores topics about all teaching-learning relationships where the actors are geographically separated, and communication takes place through technologies. Past volumes (available online) report on education through radio and television, teleconferences and recordings, printed study guides, and multimedia systems. The principal technology of contemporary distance education is the Internet, and thus most articles now report on online learning. With distance education having moved from the margins to the mainstream at all levels of education and training, and increasing numbers of individuals and institutions becoming involved, The American Journal of Distance Education provides a unique depository of previous research as well as the most recent research-based knowledge about all aspects of the pedagogy of the field. Peer reviewed articles provide reports on the latest findings in such areas as: building and sustaining effective delivery systems; course design and application of instructional design theories; facilitating interaction between students and with instructors; factors influencing student achievement and satisfaction; the changing roles of faculty and changes in institutional culture; and administrative and policy issues including cost-effectiveness and copyright."}, {"Rank": 484, "Sourceid": 5100155078, "Title": "Foundations and Trends in Computer Graphics and Vision", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "15722740", "SJR": "0,618", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q1", "H index": 25, "Total Docs.

During the last decade, the rate of change in information technology has increased.

These changes will affect the way our organizations function, will lead to new business opportunities and will create a need for new non-profit organizations. Governments and international organizations do and will have to scramble to create policies and laws for control of public goods and services such as airwaves and public networks. Educational institutions will continue to change the content of educational materials they deliver to include new knowledge and skills. In addition these institutions will change the delivery mechanisms for disseminating these materials. By definition, information technology is very wide. There are a number of journals that address different technologies such as databases, knowledge bases, multimedia, group-ware, telecommunications, etc. This current trend is understandable because these technologies are indeed complex and often have a multitude of technical issues requiring in-depth study. On the other hand, business solutions almost always require integration of a number of these technologies. Therefore it is important to have a journal where the readers will be exposed not only to different technologies but also to their impact on information system design, functionality, operations and management.

As such, we aim to publish papers presenting new research, innovative theoretical approaches, changes in agile management paradigms, and action (both examples of successes and failures as long as there are important lessons to be learned) from leading scholars and practitioners. Papers generally fall into two broad categories: those grounded in theory and/or papers using scientific research methods (e.g., reports of original empirical studies, models, critical reviews of existing empirical research, theory pieces that clearly extend current thinking); and those focusing on innovative agile approaches that are based on well reasoned extensions of existing research, experiential knowledge, or exemplary cases (e.g., thought pieces, case studies, etc)."}, {"Rank": 714, "Sourceid": 5800207369, "Title": "ACM Transactions on the Web", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "15591131", "SJR": "0,438", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q2", "H index": 44, "Total Docs.

Applied Ontology is the first journal with explicit and exclusive focus on ontological analysis and conceptual modeling under an interdisciplinary view.

For example, authors of theoretical contributions will be encouraged to show the relevance of their theory for applications, while authors of more technological papers will be encouraged to show the relevance of a well-founded theoretical perspective. Moreover, the journal will publish papers focusing on representation languages or algorithms only where these address relevant content issues, whether at the level of practical application or of theoretical understanding.

The scope, rationale, and coverage by other journals are often limited to particular aspects of reconfigurable technology or reconfigurable systems.

Topics that would be appropriate for TRETS would include all levels of reconfigurable system abstractions and all aspects of reconfigurable technology including platforms, programming environments and application successes that support these systems for computing or other applications. -The board and systems architectures of a reconfigurable platform. -Programming environments of reconfigurable systems, especially those designed for use with reconfigurable systems that will lead to increased programmer productivity. -Languages and compilers for reconfigurable systems. -Logic synthesis and related tools, as they relate to reconfigurable systems. -Applications on which success can be demonstrated. The underlying technology from which reconfigurable systems are developed. (Currently this technology is that of FPGAs, but research on the nature and use of follow-on technologies is appropriate for TRETS.) In considering whether a paper is suitable for TRETS, the foremost question should be whether reconfigurability has been essential to success. Topics such as architecture, programming languages, compilers, and environments, logic synthesis, and high performance applications are all suitable if the context is appropriate. For example, an architecture for an embedded application that happens to use FPGAs is not necessarily suitable for TRETS, but an architecture using FPGAs for which the reconfigurability of the FPGAs is an inherent part of the specifications (perhaps due to a need for re-use on multiple applications) would be appropriate for TRETS."}, {"Rank": 858, "Sourceid": 28456, "Title": "Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "09257721", "SJR": "0,355", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q3", "H index": 58, "Total Docs.

Some studies focus on individual decision-making, others focus on group decisions, others on organisational or community decision-making, and others on some combination of these. The types of studied decision systems also vary by domain. Examples include systems development, human resource management, health and wellbeing, marketing, product design, green IT, financial services, and crisis management, to name a few. JDS encourages research that draws on different backgrounds, theories, and methodologies. We are particularly welcoming to articles that seek to open up the black box of decision-making in a way that produces new insights with clear practical implications. A range of decision-related topics will be considered; examples include: -Big Data and Data Analytics- Business Intelligence- Clinical and Health Information and Decision Systems- Collaborative Decision Making- Context in Decision Making- Decision Support Systems- Decision Making During Design and Organisational Change- Distributed Decision Making- Emergency Management- Enterprise Systems- Evaluation of Decision Systems- Integrated Decision Support Systems- Intelligent or Augmented Decision Systems- Knowledge Management- Managerial Decision Making- Mindful Decision Making- Multi-Criteria Decision Making- NeuroIS- Open Decision Making Behaviour, e.g. Open Strategy, Crowd Filtering/Evaluation- Production and Logistics Systems- Sense-Making- Situational Decision Making"}, {"Rank": 869, "Sourceid": 19700181204, "Title": "OPSEARCH", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "00303887, 09750320", "SJR": "0,353", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q3", "H index": 20, "Total Docs.

However, constructivist approaches vary in function of how much influence they attribute to constructions. Many assume a dualistic relationship between reality and constructed elements. They maintain that constructed mental structures gradually adapt to the structures of the real world (e.g., Piaget). In this view perception is the pickup of information controlled by the mental structure that is constructed from earlier perceptions (e.g., Neisser). This leads to the claim that mental structures are about learning sensorimotor contingencies (e.g., O\u2019Regan). Others seek to avoid the dualistic position. Either they skeptically reject that the structures of the real world can be compared with mental ones, independently of the senses through which the mental structures were constructed in the first place (e.g., von Glasersfeld), or they embrace a phenomenological perspective that considers perception as the grouping of experiential complexes (e.g., Mach). All these approaches emphasize the primacy of the cognitive system (e.g., Llin\u00e1s) and its organizational closure (e.g., von Foerster, Maturana). Hence, perceived patterns and regularities may be regarded as invariants of inborn cognitive operators (e.g., Diettrich). Constructivist approaches can be said to differ also with respect to whether constructs are considered to populate the rational-linguistic (e.g., von Glasersfeld, Schmidt) or the biological-bodily (\u201cenactivist/embodied\u201d theories, e.g., Varela)."}, {"Rank": 975, "Sourceid": 21100332423, "Title": "APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "20487703", "SJR": "0,306", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q3", "H index": 18, "Total Docs.

ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS) is a quarterly peer-reviewed journal that publishes refereed articles addressing issues of computing that seek to address barriers to access, either creating new solutions or providing for the more inclusive design of technology to provide access for individuals with diverse abilities. The journal provides a technical forum for disseminating innovative research that covers either applications of computing and information technologies to provide assistive systems or inclusive technologies for individuals with disabilities. Some examples are web accessibility for those with visual impairments and blindness as well as web search explorations for those with limited cognitive abilities, technologies to address stroke rehabilitation or dementia care, language support systems deaf signers or those with limited language abilities, and input systems for individuals with limited ability to control traditional mouse and keyboard systems. The journal is of particular interest to SIGACCESS members and delegates to its affiliated conference (i.e., ASSETS) as well as other international accessibility conferences.

When typewriters were first introduced, the keys were arranged in alphabetical order. However this order meant that people typed too quickly such that the keys soon became entangled. To counter this, the keys were displayed in random order and typing speeds accordingly slowed down. In later years, despite the fact that the problem of speed had been completely overcome, the keyboard retained its random order. In our view, this represents an excellent metaphor for the entanglement of culture and technological tools. In actual fact, we regard computer-based technologies as cultural artefacts, representing different depths in the daily work and study activity of individuals, social groups, and institutions. We believe that different models of computer use and activity within online environments mediate social interaction. As such, the relationship between culture and technological tools is becoming more and more complex and now provides an opportunity for determining new models of cognitive, psychological, and social interaction. Qwerty hopes to be a place where such issues can be discussed and developed. The journal arises from a growing awareness of the need to develop research and reflection on the impact, effects and nature of technology use and, as such, is intended to be a genuinely cross-disciplinary forum. Qwerty wishes to provide a forum for discussion on the use of new technologies aimed at anyone interested in the use of technology in such fields as education, training, social and university research, including the cultural, social, pedagogical, psychological, economic, professional, ethical and aesthetical aspects of technology use."}, {"Rank": 1184, "Sourceid": 21100898028, "Title": "Educar", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "0211819X, 20148801", "SJR": "0,230", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q3", "H index": 3, "Total Docs.

In addition, the journal has a keen focus on drawing out practical implications for users and how/why technology may have a positive impact. This includes messages for users, practitioners, researchers, stakeholders and caregivers (in the broadest sense). The impact of research in this arena is vital and therefore we are committed to publishing work that helps draw this out; thus providing implications for practice. JET aims to raise awareness of available and developing technologies and their uses in health, social care and education for a wide and varied readership. The areas in which technologies can be enabling for the scope of JET include, but are not limited to: Communication and interaction, Learning, Independence and autonomy, Identity and culture, Safety, Health, Care and support, Wellbeing, Quality of life, Access to services."}, {"Rank": 1237, "Sourceid": 21100892782, "Title": "Journal of Payments Strategy and Systems", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "17501806, 17501814", "SJR": "0,219", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q3", "H index": 3, "Total Docs.

The journal focuses on publishing critical yet constructive studies of IT development, use and design. The journal draws on the rich and well-established Scandinavian research tradition (Iivari & Lyytinen, 1998) that emphasizes engagement with the field, participation from users, and multi-vocality of interests (Bjerknes, 2016; Ehn, 1989; Mathiassen & Nielsen, 2008). A key characteristic of Scandinavian IS research is that it challenges a purely technical perspective and does not focus on technology per se. Instead it extends to sociotechnical issues on different levels: the interaction level (HCI, UX and interfaces), the individual level (job satisfaction, job design and automation), the organizational level (organizational change, decision making, business models and strategy) and/or societal level (including issues such as unemployment, privacy and wealth distribution) (Bj\u00f8rn-Andersen & Clemmensen, 2017). Furthermore, design has been at the core of Scandinavian IS since its inception (\u00c5gerfalk & Wiberg, 2018). Design-oriented research and research related to purposeful change induced by Information Systems within and beyond organizations are key areas of interest within the Scandinavian tradition. Because geographical boundaries do not confine to this kind of scholarly work, one should interpret the term \u201cScandinavian\u201d metaphorically rather than literally, as an ambition to foster this tradition.

As the internet of things continues to grow, billions and trillions of data bytes need to be moved, stored and shared. The energy thus consumed and the climate impact of data centers are increasing dramatically, thereby becoming significant contributors to global warming and climate change. As reported recently, the combined electricity consumption of the world\u2019s data centers has already exceeded that of some of the world's top ten economies. In the ensuing process of integrating traditional and renewable energy, monitoring and managing various energy sources, and processing and transferring technological information through various channels, IT will undoubtedly play an ever-increasing and central role. Several technologies are currently racing to production to meet this challenge, from \u2018smart dust\u2019 to hybrid networks capable of controlling the emergence of dependable and reliable green and energy-efficient ecosystems \u2013 which we generically term the \u2018energy web\u2019 \u2013 calling for major paradigm shifts highly disruptive of the ways the energy sector functions today. The EAI Transactions on Energy Web are positioned at the forefront of these efforts and provide a forum for the most forward-looking, state-of-the-art research bringing together the cross section of IT and Energy communities. The journal will publish original works reporting on prominent advances that challenge traditional thinking."}, {"Rank": 1498, "Sourceid": 4000151614, "Title": "Eurasip Journal on Embedded Systems", "Type": "journal", "Issn": "16873955, 16873963", "SJR": "0,145", "SJR Best Quartile": "Q4", "H index": 26, "Total Docs.

The mission is to generate a set of materials that, in scientific papers form, allow the design work get closer to the empirical field and farther away from the practices based on individual experiences and often poorly reproducible by others. Therefore, we aim at building a space, a metaphorical space, a graphic space about scientific evidence to enable progress towards intellectual and professional graphic design. We consider graphic design as an activity that is very present at society and is therefore an activity that quietly produces a strong influence on it. In this regard, we design products as a way of communication between people, between organizations and people, and that is why we consider graphic design as an integrated system of signs of intentional communication that requires special attention. Especially, considering that design is, while a carrier of communication strategies, who interacts with receptors. In this sense, the study of this mediated communication by the graphic elements is, in our opinion, absolutely necessary.

Our primary goal is to bring together in productive dialogue scholars conducting advanced research in the theoretical humanities. As well as offering innovative approaches to influential crosscurrents in contemporary thinking, the journal seeks to contribute fresh angles to the academic subject of English and promote shape-changing research across conventional boundaries. By virtue of its dynamic and varied profile and of the intercultural dialogue that it caters for, ABC Studies aims to fill a gap in the Romanian academic arena, and function as the first publication to approach Anglophone studies in a multi-disciplinary perspective. Within the proposed range of diversity, our major scope is to provide close examinations and lucid analyses of the role and future of the academic institutions at the cutting edge of high-tech. With this end in view, we especially invite contributions in the fields of Comparative Literary and Cultural Studies, Postcolonial Theory, Area Studies, Cultural Anthropology, Language and Linguistics, Multimedia and Digital Arts, Translation Studies and related subjects.
